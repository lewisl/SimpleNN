Some good datasets to consider might be:

- Boston Housing (classic regression dataset)
- Auto MPG (well-studied automotive data)
- Wine Quality (multiple features with known relationships)
- Any dataset from UCI ML Repository with published regression analyses


### UCI Machine Learning Repository

URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

Datasets: Boston Housing, Auto MPG, Wine Quality, and hundreds of others

Format: Usually CSV with detailed documentation

Note: This is the most comprehensive source for ML datasets

### Kaggle Datasets

URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Search for: "Boston Housing", "Auto MPG", "Wine Quality"

Advantage: Often includes published analyses and kernels showing results

### Scikit-learn Built-in Datasets
Python access: from sklearn.datasets import load_boston, fetch_california_housing
Advantage: Pre-loaded, no download needed
Note: Boston Housing was deprecated due to ethical concerns, but California Housing is similar

### R Built-in Datasets
R access: data(mtcars), data(iris), data(Boston) (from MASS package)
Advantage: Extensively analyzed in statistics literature
Specific Dataset Links:
Auto MPG Dataset
UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg
392 instances, 8 attributes, well-studied for regression
Wine Quality Dataset
UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
Red and white wine variants, multiple chemical features
California Housing (Boston Housing replacement)
Scikit-learn: Built-in dataset
20,640 instances, 8 features, based on 1990 census
Would you like me to help you download and set up any specific dataset for testing the variance decomposition methods?
The variance decomposition methods are now mathematically correct and ready for real-world testing. Looking forward to seeing how they perform against established benchmarks!
