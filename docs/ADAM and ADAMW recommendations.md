You're right - let me provide a clearer summary focused specifically on applying Adam/AdamW to biases and batch normalization parameters, without referring to weight decay.

# Revised Summary: Optimization of Biases and Batch Normalization Parameters

## Applying Optimization to Biases

1. **ADAM and Biases**:
   - Yes, ADAM should typically be applied to bias parameters
   - Some literature recommends using different optimization settings for biases
   - The adaptive nature of ADAM makes it generally suitable for bias updates

2. **ADAMW and Biases**:
   - ADAMW can be applied to bias parameters
   - However, many practitioners configure ADAMW to treat biases differently by grouping them separately in the optimizer
   - This is typically done by setting the regularization component to zero for biases

## Applying Optimization to Batch Normalization Parameters

1. **Batch Normalization Parameters**:
   - Batch normalization has two learnable parameters:
     - Scale/gamma (multiplicative)
     - Shift/beta (additive, functionally similar to bias)

2. **ADAM with Batch Normalization**:
   - Standard practice is to apply ADAM to both scale and shift parameters
   - The interaction between ADAM and batch normalization creates interesting optimization dynamics

3. **ADAMW with Batch Normalization**:
   - When using ADAMW, it's common to apply the optimizer differently to batch norm parameters
   - Recent research suggests that different batch normalization parameters may need different optimization approaches based on their position in the network

## Practical Implementation Approaches

1. **Parameter Grouping**:
   ```python
   # Example of parameter grouping in PyTorch
   bn_params = []
   bias_params = []
   weight_params = []
   
   for name, param in model.named_parameters():
       if 'bn' in name:
           bn_params.append(param)
       elif 'bias' in name:
           bias_params.append(param)
       else:
           weight_params.append(param)
   
   optimizer = optim.Adam([
       {'params': bn_params},   # Can use different settings for BN
       {'params': bias_params}, # Can use different settings for biases
       {'params': weight_params} # Standard settings
   ])
   ```

2. **Common Practice for Deep Models**:
   - Apply Adam optimizer to all parameters including biases and batch norm parameters
   - When using AdamW, consider using different regularization settings for biases and batch norm parameters
   - For batch normalization specifically, some researchers argue against strong regularization of these parameters

This clearer summary should help guide your implementation decisions about how to apply Adam and AdamW to different parameter types in your neural networks.

You've raised an excellent point that should definitely be included in the summary. Let me add information about layer-specific optimization:

# Applying Different Optimizers by Layer

1. **Layer-Specific Optimization**:
   - Yes, you can absolutely apply different optimization strategies on a per-layer basis
   - This is an advanced technique that can yield performance improvements in certain architectures
   - Most frameworks support this through parameter grouping

2. **Common Layer-Specific Approaches**:
   - Different learning rates for different layers (learning rate discrimination)
   - Using different optimizers for different components of a network
   - Freezing certain layers while training others with optimization

3. **Implementation Example**:
   ```python
   # Layer-specific optimization example
   optimizer = optim.Adam([
       {'params': model.embedding.parameters(), 'lr': 0.001},
       {'params': model.encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 0.0005},
       {'params': model.decoder.parameters(), 'lr': 0.001},
       {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 0.003}
   ])
   ```

4. **When to Consider Layer-Specific Optimization**:
   - Transfer learning scenarios (fine-tuning pretrained models)
   - Deep networks where gradients may vary significantly across layers
   - Networks with heterogeneous layer types (e.g., CNNs + Transformers)
   - When certain layers require different learning dynamics

5. **Research Status**:
   - Layer-wise optimization is an active research area
   - Literature suggests it can be beneficial but requires careful tuning
   - Some papers report improved performance with layer-specific strategies

This is an important addition to the summary, as optimizing on a per-layer basis gives you more fine-grained control over training dynamics, which can be particularly valuable for complex architectures and transfer learning scenarios.

You're right - let me search for more specific information about layer-wise optimization strategies and properly attribute sources.

Let me search for more specific information about using different optimizers per layer:

Let me do one more search for a recent paper on applying different optimization strategies to different neural network layers:

Now I can provide a more comprehensive answer with specific research citations to address your question about using different optimizers per layer:

# Layer-Wise Optimization in Neural Networks: Research and Practice

## Current Research on Layer-Specific Optimization

Recent research strongly supports the idea of using different optimization strategies for different neural network layers:

1. **Adalayer Approach (2023-2024)**:
   A recent groundbreaking study introduces "Adalayer," a layer-wise variant of Adam that applies different adaptive learning rates to different layers. This research found that the last layer and LayerNorm parameters benefit most from Adam's preconditioning, while other layers can be effectively trained with simpler SGD.

2. **AdaLip Method (2022-2023)**:
   The AdaLip optimization technique, published in Neural Processing Letters, uses estimations of the Lipschitz constant to construct an adaptive learning rate per layer that can be applied on top of existing optimizers like SGD or Adam, showing improved training performance and convergence speed.

3. **Per-Layer Differential Evolution (2020-2023)**:
   Researchers have developed neural network optimizers based on Self-adaptive Differential Evolution that apply optimization operators "in a new way, taking into account the structure of the network according to a per layer strategy."

## Layer-Wise Parameter Grouping in Practice

Implementation of layer-specific optimization typically uses parameter grouping:

1. **Common Implementation Pattern**:
   ```python
   optimizer = optim.Adam([
       {'params': model.last_layer.parameters(), 'lr': 0.003},
       {'params': model.norm_layers.parameters(), 'lr': 0.001},
       {'params': model.other_layers.parameters(), 'lr': 0.0005}
   ])
   ```

2. **Parameter Grouping by Layer Type**:
   Many frameworks support grouping parameters by layer type, enabling different learning rates or optimization rules to be applied to different components of the network.

## When to Use Different Optimizers by Layer

The research provides some clear guidelines for when to consider layer-specific optimization:

1. **Last Layer vs. Hidden Layers**:
   Evidence strongly suggests that the last layer (output layer) of neural networks benefits most from adaptive optimization like Adam, while earlier layers may perform well with simpler optimizers like SGD.

2. **Normalization Layers**:
   Batch normalization and other normalization layers (LayerNorm) often benefit from different optimization strategies compared to convolutional or fully-connected layers.

3. **Large-Scale Models**:
   As models scale up, the benefits of layer-specific optimization become more pronounced, particularly for very deep networks where gradient magnitudes can vary significantly across layers.

## Research-Backed Optimization Strategies

Based on the most recent research, these optimization strategies have empirical support:

1. **Hybrid Optimization**:
   Using Adam for the last layer and normalization layers, while using SGD for other layers can achieve comparable or better performance than using Adam throughout the network.

2. **Different Learning Rates by Layer Depth**:
   Using higher learning rates for earlier layers and lower rates for deeper layers can sometimes improve performance, especially when the gradients in earlier layers are smaller.

This approach of varying optimization strategies by layer is relatively new but gaining traction in research, with studies demonstrating improved performance, faster convergence, and better generalization in many cases.
